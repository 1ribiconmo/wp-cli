According to Coleman, the Committee of 300 is composed of members of the British royal family, the European nobility, the banking and financial elite, the heads of multinational corporations, the leaders of secret societies, and influential figures from the media, academia, religion, and politics. The book claims that the Committee of 300 has a network of subversive organizations that work to advance its agenda, such as the Bilderberg Group, the Council on Foreign Relations, the Trilateral Commission, the Club of Rome, and the United Nations.
 
Coleman argues that the Committee of 300 is behind many of the major events and trends that have shaped the world in the past and present, such as wars, revolutions, assassinations, coups, famines, pandemics, terrorism, drug trafficking, social engineering, cultural degradation, environmental degradation, and economic crises. The book asserts that the ultimate goal of the Committee of 300 is to create a one-world government that would enslave humanity under a totalitarian dictatorship.
 
The book also offers some suggestions on how to resist and expose the Committee of 300 and its plans. Coleman urges readers to educate themselves and others about the true nature of the world situation and to challenge the official narratives and propaganda. He also encourages readers to support alternative media and independent research that expose the hidden agendas and conspiracies. He also advises readers to form groups and networks of like-minded people who can share information and resources and take action to defend their rights and freedoms.

Das Komitee der 300 is a book that has sparked a lot of debate and controversy among its readers and critics. Some people regard it as a valuable source of information and insight into the hidden forces that shape the world. Others dismiss it as a paranoid and unfounded conspiracy theory that lacks evidence and logic. The book is not intended to be a definitive or comprehensive account of the Committee of 300, but rather a personal and subjective interpretation of the author's research and experience.
 
The book invites readers to question and investigate the claims and arguments that it presents and to form their own opinions and conclusions. The book also challenges readers to think critically and independently about the world they live in and to seek the truth behind the appearances. The book is not meant to instill fear or despair, but rather to inspire awareness and action. The book is a call for people to wake up and take back their power from the elites who seek to control them.
