If you have been playing Payday 2 online, you may have encountered a situation where you or someone else in your lobby gets a cheater tag next to their name. This tag is meant to warn other players that you are using some kind of cheat or mod that gives you an unfair advantage. However, sometimes the tag can be triggered by mistake or by a bug in the game. In this article, we will explain what causes the cheater tag, how to avoid it, and how to remove it if you get it.

## What Causes the Cheater Tag?
 
The cheater tag is a feature of Payday 2 that detects certain actions or items that are considered cheating by the game's developers. Some of the common reasons for getting the tag are:
 
- Using a DLC unlocker or a skin unlocker that gives you access to items that you have not purchased or earned legitimately.
- Using a mod that alters the game's mechanics, such as infinite ammo, invincibility, instant drills, etc.
- Using a trainer or a cheat engine that allows you to manipulate the game's variables, such as money, skill points, level, etc.
- Spawning too many bags or picking up too many bags in a heist.
- Equipping more than one deployable item or more than one weapon mod of the same type.
- Equipping items that are incompatible with your level or perk deck.

Note that some of these reasons may not apply to all players, as some mods are whitelisted by the developers and do not trigger the tag. Also, some players may get the tag by accident or by glitch, such as joining a lobby with a cheater host or having high desync issues.
 
## How to Avoid the Cheater Tag?
 
The best way to avoid getting the cheater tag is to play the game legitimately and avoid using any cheats or mods that give you an unfair advantage. However, if you want to use mods for cosmetic or quality-of-life purposes, you should check if they are whitelisted by the developers and do not interfere with the game's balance.

Another way to avoid getting the tag is to be careful when joining online lobbies. Some hosts may use cheats or mods that affect the whole lobby and cause everyone to get tagged. If you see something suspicious in a lobby, such as too many assets, too many bags, too high level, etc., you should leave and find another one. You can also use filters or friends-only settings to join lobbies that match your preferences.
 
## How to Remove the Cheater Tag?
 
If you get the cheater tag for any reason, there are a few ways to remove it. The easiest way is to simply leave the lobby and join another one. The tag is not permanent and only applies to the heist/map where you were detected cheating. However, this may not work if you have a persistent cheat or mod that keeps triggering the tag every time you join a lobby.
 
Another way to remove the tag is to reset your progress or go infamous. This will erase all your money, level, skills, weapons, masks, etc., and start you from scratch. This may seem drastic, but it will also remove any traces of cheating from your account. However, this may not work if you have a DLC unlocker or a skin unlocker that keeps giving you items that you do not own.
